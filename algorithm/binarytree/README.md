A tree is one of the data structure and it has one node as root and list of other node called as child nodes.
Binary tree is one of the most typical tree structure. As the name suggests,a binary tree is a tree datastructure
each node has atmost two children, which is referred as left child and the right child.

##Tree Traversing

* Pre-Order
* In Order
* Post-Order

#Pre-Order:(root, left, right)
In this traversal is to visit the root first. Then traverse the left sub tree. Finally, traverse the right sub tree.

#In Order:(left, root, right)
In this traversal is to visit left sub tree first. Then visit at the root. Finally, traverse the right sub tree.

#Post Order:(left, right, root)
In this traversal is to visit left sub tree first. Then traverse the right sub tree. Finally, traverse the root.
